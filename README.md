Robotic Arm – Tinkercad Project
This is a simple 3D model of a robotic arm created using Tinkercad.
The design is intended for educational purposes, prototyping, and to demonstrate the basic concept of mechanical arm movement with servo motors.

Project Files
robot_arm.stl → Main 3D model for the robotic arm.

robot_arm.png → Snapshot of the design in Tinkercad.

Tools Used
Tinkercad → 3D modeling.

Fusion 360 (optional) → For advanced modifications.

.STL format → For 3D printing or further editing.

How It Works
The robotic arm consists of the following parts:

Base → Holds the main support and allows rotation using a servo motor (Servo 1).

Vertical Support → Provides height and stability.

Rotating Arm → Connected to the vertical support and controlled by a second servo (Servo 2) for horizontal movement.

Gripper → Simple claw or holder at the end of the arm (optional third servo for opening/closing).

Work Area → Objects placed near the arm for pick-and-place actions.

The movement is achieved by connecting servo motors to each joint, allowing:

Base rotation.

Arm up/down movement.

Gripper control (optional).

Connecting the Motors
Servo 1 (Base): Mounted at the center of the base using screws or a printed bracket to control the entire arm rotation.

Servo 2 (Arm): Placed at the pivot point between the vertical support and the rotating arm to control up and down movement.

Servo 3 (Gripper) [Optional]: Attached at the end of the arm to open and close the gripper or holder.

Electronics
Each servo is connected to an Arduino (or any microcontroller).

Power (VCC) and Ground (GND) lines are shared.

Signal pins are connected to Arduino PWM pins (e.g., D3, D5, D6).

How to Use
Import the .STL file into Tinkercad or Fusion 360 if you want to modify it.

3D print the parts.

Mount the servos using screws or printed brackets.

Connect servos to Arduino or your preferred controller.
